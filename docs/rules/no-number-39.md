# Forbid the use number `39`

The use of the number `39` is a bad omen. The number 39 has somehow become lodged in the Afghan popular imagination as a sign of pimping and prostitution, but it has widely been claimed to have been associated with a pimp, allegedly living in the western city of Herat, who was nicknamed "39" after the registration plate of his expensive car and the number of his apartment. The number is said to translate into morda-gow, literally meaning "dead cow" but a well-known slang term for a pimp. 

Use a different amount.


### Fail

```js
const a = 39;

```

```js
const myVariable539 = (a) => a*2;

```


### Pass

```js
const a = 7;
```
