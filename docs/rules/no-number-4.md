# Forbid the use number `4`

The use of the number `4` is a bad omen. The Chinese word for four (四, pinyin: sì, jyutping: sei), sounds quite similar to the word for death (死, pinyin: sǐ, jyutping: sei), in many varieties of Chinese. Similarly, the Sino-Japanese, Sino-Korean, and Sino-Vietnamese words for four, shi (し, Japanese), and sa (사, Korean), sound similar or identical to death in each language (see Korean numerals, Japanese numerals, Vietnamese numerals). 

Use a different amount.
